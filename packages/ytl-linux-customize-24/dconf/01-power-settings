# Disable sleep timeouts as well as lid and power button actions on login screen before first login.
# Before the first Cinnamon session is started after boot, the power settings of Unity Greeter (login screen) are in effect.
# This causes the computer to sleep if left sitting in login screen after install or boot.
# Additionally, the computer might not recover from this sleep but show a black screen instead after waking up.
# The only solution is to reboot the computer by long-pressing the power button or by going blind to e.g. tty2 using Ctrl+Alt+F2 and then rebooting using Ctrl+Alt+Delete.

# Do the same just in case for Gnome settings. This might not be necessary, but won't hurt either.
# The combination of Unity Greeter, Cinnamon Desktop and LightDM Display Manager is somewhat unstable and settings from multiple components can conflict.
